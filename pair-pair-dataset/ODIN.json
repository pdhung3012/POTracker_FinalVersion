ODIN leverages two easily implementable standards for reporting electrical power outage data via Common Information Model \n(CIM) IEC 61968-3 and MultiSpeak. \n \nSteps for implementing and sending CIM IEC 61968-3 standardized outage data \n \nBefore getting started: Testing is recommended and should be performed on the test environment first before sending outage \ninformation to production or https://odin.ornl.gov/. The document will refer to these environments as “test” and “production”. \n \nURLs for Test environment  \n• ODIN Test website (Register account) - https://staging-odin.ornl.gov/ \n• ODIN Authentication/Token Test Website (POST requests only) - https://staging-odin-security.ornl.gov/oauth2/token \n \nURLs for Production environment (to be used only after successful testing) \n• ODIN Production website (Register account) - https://odin.ornl.gov/  \n• ODIN Authentication/Token Production Website (POST requests only) - https://production-security-odin.ornl.gov/oauth2/token  \n \n \nStep 1: New account registration  \n \n1. Go to the ODIN website (for test or production) \n2. Click on “Login” button (see image at the bottom left) and then click on “Create New Account” (see image at the bottom right)"

Once the account is approved you will receive \nan email with further instructions on how to send outage information to ODIN. \n \n \nStep 2: Sharing standardized outage data using CIM IEC 61968-3 \n \nThe XSD (located in the Appendix B - PubOutages Files (XSD, PNG, HTML and OWL) can be used to generate the code. ODIN \naccepts standardized outage data in various granularity including county (FIPS code), zip code, and via geography information like point \nand polygon features if that level of detail can be provided. In addition, we provide an OpenAPI / Swagger reference page that can be \nused as well to generate an HTTP REST client with a tool such as Swagger CodeGen that can be used to handle this for you automatically. \nThe OpenAPI endpoint can be viewed by going to https://odin.ornl.gov/swagger-ui/index.html on our test environment. \n \nPlease use the outage data example section as a reference.  \n• For example, county outage data: the “communityDescriptor” field needs a US FIPS County Code along with the number of \nmeters affected in “metersAffected” field and the “outageAreaKind” field set to “county.” This is the minimum information that \nis needed to get data passed into ODIN and see if that works and go from there. We also strongly recommend that you provide \nODIN an outage event identifier via the mRID which allows ODIN to track the status of the outage event and to establish the \nrelationship between your outage management system and the outage event data provided to ODIN.  \n \n \nStep 3: Send Outage Information to ODIN Securely"

        "text": "Once your account has been approved for access, you should now be able to push outage information to ODIN using one of the accepted \noutage data models.  \n \n3 steps are required to request an access token and then pass that token to ODIN along with the outage request.  These steps may be \ncompleted in the language or programming environment of your choice.  \n \n1. Send a POST request to the ODIN Authentication/Token server for test or production environments (URLs for Test environment \nand URLs for Production environment) using basic authorization with the username/password that you created for ODIN.  \n• A basic authorization header is a base-64 encoded string that contains the “username:password” for the account, but most \nscripting or programming languages can also handle this natively for you as part of the HTTP request.  \n• This POST will also need to include a form/URL-encoded parameter called “grant_type” with the value set to \n“client_credentials.” An example of what this looks like in a request is pictured below.  \n \n2. After a POST request is sent to the authorization server, you should receive back a JSON message with a status of 200 (OK) response. \nThe message body (which is pictured below) will contain an “access_token” property that contains your authentication credentials \nthat will be passed to ODIN. This token is only valid and will expire after five minutes has passed by default. \n \n3. Now, simply use HTTP POST the outage feed to ODIN (see endpoints below) at the /odin/outage endpoint in the body of the \nrequest as normal. \n• Endpoints: \no Test environment: https://staging-odin.ornl.gov/odin/outage"

We use this identifier to describe the outage event \nand track the status of the outage event over time. \n● Utility Name \no A utility name must be sent using the name attribute.  \no While uniqueness is preferred, utility name is not required to be unique. The utility name reported to the U.S. Energy \nInformation Administration (EIA) is recommended.  If you do not know your utility’s EIA utility name, visit the EIA \nwebsite and review the latest annual report, you may contact the ODIN team.  \n● Utility ID (must be unique on the ODIN system) \no A unique utility id must be sent using the name attribute.

ODIN recommends ISO-8601 format. All time should be reported \nin UTC. \no ODIN currently allows time data in a string format due to time/date format variance across utility outage reporting."
